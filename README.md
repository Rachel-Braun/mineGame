# mineGame
Minesweeper is a classic computer game that challenges players to solve puzzles and uncover safe areas on the game board while avoiding mines. The game takes place on a square grid, which contains empty cells, cells with mines, and cells that contain numbers. The numbers indicate how many mines are located in the adjacent cells.
